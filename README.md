# README

# Welcome to Josh and David's Final Project for CS 330, taught by Roman Yasinovskyy
* In this project, we scrape player and team data from espn.com and compile them into a database
* We then create an API that returns information from that database in JSON format
* Our Flask application then opens a web app that we will continue to develop, which in turn uses the API

# General Info
* Stats for players are as follows:
* ["GP","GS","MIN","PTS","OR","DR","REB","AST","STL","BLK","TO","PF","AST/TO","PER"]
